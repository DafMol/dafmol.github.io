                An English philosopher who is often seen as one of the earliest thinkers of modern political philosophy.
                His most famous work without a doubt is the Leviathan. In it he describes why humankind needs political states
                and he shows how the power-balance, rights and duties should be divided between the modern political sovereign and his(/her) commonwealth.

                <p class="philo-paragraph">
                A French philosopher who is known for his history-focussed methodology (Genealogies). His works mainly target the
                relationships that exist between power, knowledge and social institutions in societies all throughout
                human history. His most famous works is Discipline and Punish, wherein he describes how societies have punished
                criminals or dissonants and how changes in these methods of punishment align with changes in societal power structures.
                He argues that modern societies have increasingly become the equivalents of prisons thanks to subtle changes in locus and
                structure of societal power.

                <p class="philo-paragraph">
                A German philosopher and sociologist who is often seen as one of the most prominent early post-war thinkers to propose critical
                societal theories. His magnus opus is Dialectic of Enlightenment, an attempted modernization and application of Marx's critiques 
                of capitalism on contemporary late stage capitalism. He details amongst others how art and culture have changed over time to be mere tools of 
                late state capitalist power structures; they have become capitalist commodities that rob people of their imagination and enforce conformity.
